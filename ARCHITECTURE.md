# NineTilesPuzzle — Architecture Overview

Snapshot of the current codebase structure, as of 2026-06-20. This is a descriptive
document — see `ROADMAP.md` §6 for the one open architectural question still being tracked
(how game-mode-specific behavior should be modeled once a second real mode beyond Zen
exists).

## Tech stack

- SwiftUI, iOS only, dark-mode-locked (`.preferredColorScheme(.dark)`)
- `@Observable` classes for shared state (no `ObservableObject`/Combine)
- Swift Concurrency throughout (`async/await`, structured `Task`s) — no GCD
- Persistence: `UserDefaults` only, no SwiftData/CloudKit yet — but abstracted behind a
  `PersistenceStore` protocol (see below), so that's a non-disruptive future swap
- Swift Testing (not XCTest) for unit tests
- No third-party dependencies

## Core data flow

```
NineTilesPuzzleApp.init()
   constructs, in dependency order:
     StatsStore()  SettingsStore()  AchievementsStore()  ──▶  GameSession(stats:, achievements:, settings:)
   (each store defaults its `defaults:` param to UserDefaults.standard via PersistenceStore)
   injects all four + SoundService into the environment (app-wide singletons)
        │
        ▼
MenuView ── NavigationStack(GameRoute) ──▶ PuzzleView / GameModeView / StatsView / ...
        (each view reads only the store(s) it actually needs from the environment)
        │
        ▼
GameSession (@Observable, @MainActor)
   • owns: gridSize/mediaSourceType/selectedGameMode config, tiles, images, timers, live flags
   • owns instances of: ClassicEngine, SlideEngine
   • depends on (read-only): StatsStore, AchievementsStore, SettingsStore, PersistenceStore
   • talks directly to: PersistenceStore (its own keys), ImageService, ImageSlicer
        │
        ├─ selectedGameMode ──▶ activeEngine (computed: .slide → SlideEngine, else Classic)
        │                              │
        │                  shuffle() / isSolved()   (shared GameEngine protocol)
        │                  swap() / slide()         (mode-specific, called directly by GameSession)
        │
        └─ registerMove() reports completions/streaks to StatsStore, then asks
           AchievementsStore.checkAchievements(using: StatsStore) to re-evaluate unlocks
```

**Four stores, one dependency direction.** `GameSession` is the only one with dependencies
(`StatsStore`, `AchievementsStore`, `SettingsStore`, injected at init); the other three know
nothing about each other or about `GameSession`. This used to be a single god object
(`PuzzleState`) owning all five concerns — split in June 2026. Why the boundaries fell where
they did:
- **`GameSession`** owns `gridSize`/`mediaSourceType`/`selectedGameMode` (not `SettingsStore`)
  because changing them must synchronously clear the in-progress board — keeping that inside
  one type avoids needing cross-store reactive wiring.
- **`StatsStore`** doesn't know "current" anything (no grid size, no selected mode) — it only
  answers questions keyed by `StatsKey`. `GameSession` exposes the "for current size/mode"
  convenience accessors (`currentStreakForCurrentSize`, `classicBestMovesForCurrentSize`, …)
  since it's the one place that knows what "current" means.
- **`AchievementsStore.checkAchievements(using:)`** takes `StatsStore` as a parameter rather
  than holding a permanent reference, so it stays decoupled and easy to test with fake stats.

**`PersistenceStore`** (`Models/PersistenceStore.swift`) — a minimal protocol mirroring the
handful of `UserDefaults` methods the four stores actually use (`set`/`object`/`string`/
`data`/`integer`/`double`/`bool`/`removeObject`, all keyed by `String`). `UserDefaults`
conforms with no extra code; each store's `init` takes `defaults: PersistenceStore =
UserDefaults.standard`. This isn't a full repository/DAO layer — it's deliberately just
enough indirection that tests can swap in an in-memory fake (`InMemoryPersistenceStore`,
test-target-only) instead of touching real persisted app data, and it's the seam a future
SwiftData migration would slot behind.

**`PuzzleCompletionViewModel`** (`Views/Puzzle/PuzzleCompletionViewModel.swift`) — the
sequencing/timing logic that used to live directly in `PuzzleView`'s body and `onChange`/
`.task` handlers: the completion banner's lifetime and drag-to-dismiss gesture, how long
new-record badges stay visible, and Zen mode's breathe-and-fade transition into the next
puzzle. Takes no store dependencies — callers pass live values and closures per call — so
it's constructible and testable with zero environment setup.

**Game modes today**: `GameMode` is 7 cases, but `isAvailable` gates 3 of them
(`.classic`, `.slide`, `.zen`); the other 4 are listed in the UI as "Coming soon…" with no
behavior. Mode-specific behavior is still expressed as scattered conditionals (`isZenMode`,
`selectedGameMode == .slide`, `settingsStore.debugOverlayEnabled`) inside `GameSession` and
`PuzzleView`/`PuzzleGridView` — the store split and view model extraction didn't address
this axis, since with only Zen as a real data point any `GameModeRules`-style abstraction
would be guessing at shape (see `ROADMAP.md` §6). Worth revisiting once Time Trial or
Limited Moves actually exists.

**Image pipeline**: `ImageSource` protocol → `RemoteImageSource` (picsum.photos) /
`PhotoLibraryImageSource` / `LocalImageSource` (bundled fallback) → `ImageService` (primary
+ fallback on `URLError`) → `ImageSlicer` (center-crop + slice into per-tile `CGImage`s,
stored in `GameSession.tileImages`).

**Persistence**: still `UserDefaults` only, but behind `PersistenceStore` now (see above),
and each store owns and persists only its own keys. `StatsStore`'s per-`(gridSize,
gameMode)` stats use string-keyed lookups built from a `3...8 × GameMode.allCases` loop. No
SwiftData yet (flagged in `ROADMAP.md` §4 as the natural next step once stats history/charts
are wanted).

**Testing**: `NineTilesPuzzleTests` is a real Unit Testing Bundle target (added manually in
Xcode in June 2026 — it existed as a folder of source files for a while before that without
ever actually being wired up or compiled). 77 tests currently pass, covering: both engines
and `SlideSolver`, `ImageService`/`ImageSlicer`, all four stores (`StatsStore` and
`AchievementsStore` via `InMemoryPersistenceStore`), and `PuzzleCompletionViewModel`. Getting
the target wired up surfaced three real, previously-undetected bugs that had been sitting
in untested code paths — two missing imports and one test with a geometrically-invalid
fixture (asserted a slide between two non-adjacent grid cells) — all fixed once the target
could finally compile and run them.
